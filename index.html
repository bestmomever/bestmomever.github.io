									<p>✨ literally, like packing us up every time we move, in college and beyond;</p>

							<div class="full-text">
								<p>One of my favorite memories with you is, of course, our first Burn together! 🎇 Everything from packing that underpowered, undersized "SUV" to the gills with our tetris skills (and of course cracking the windshield along the way), to the drive, to the week of the Burn itself.</p>
								<p>I tell everyone the story of how my mom won Burning Man her first year and didn't need any babysitting! I remember you coming back to camp every day with new friends in tow and gifts you'd received from your solo adventures, as if this was your 10th Burn and not your first. And that you'd come back every morning from YET ANOTHER plane ride and would convince lots of the Monks to go with you.</p>
								<p>I really appreciated that we got to go visit the Man midweek and try out some of the cool workshops, and that we got to spend Burn night together (even if some of it was spent dozing off). Then last year, finally getting to join you on the plane ride was one of the most memorable experiences of my life.</p>
								<p>Thank you for always seeking out fun new experiences and wanting to include the people you love in them.</p>

								<p>I literally would not have made it through the past couple of years without you. Thank you for always being our biggest cheerleaders; even when I feel like my world might be ending, you always find a way to turn me towards the light, and help me reach it. ⛅️</p>
								<p>You are the most generous person I know by far, and I'm so fortunate and grateful to have you in my corner. I finally feel like I'm really coming into my own, and these limitless possibilities wouldn't have been conceivable in the slightest without you guiding and shaping me all these years.</p>

								<p>I really appreciate your commitment to family — to staying in touch with us, offering us advice and support, and wanting to be part of our lives. So many of our catch up calls end up centering more on what I'm up to and how I'm doing, and how I might best navigate a certain challenge that's come up (but you know, I'm always happy to hear what's new with you, too).</p>

								<p>I remember fondly our many trips to Italy 🇮🇹 with family as a kid. I remember a couple of different instances really well...</p>
								<p>Once we got some of the best gelato I'd ever had in Firenze, and when we got back to the car, there was a traffic cop writing us a ticket! So, you conveniently forgot your fluent Italian and pretended to not understand anything, chalking the whole thing up to a 'silly American tourist' mistake 😂</p>
								<p>Somehow you're always prepared for any situation we come across!</p>

							<div class="full-text">
								<p>It's been so great having you visit and stay with me so often in San Francisco — with all of us spread so far apart these days, we tend to come together mostly for special occasions, so it's increasingly rare that we get non-hectic downtime to just hang out and enjoy being together!</p>
								<p>On the surface it may sound lame, but normal things like being able to cook for each other and have work parties and take Fuzz to the park are all such a treat. I can't wait to drive your moving truck cross-country with you, each mile getting closer to making these a more regular occurrence!</p>

								<p>I tell everyone that my mom had the coolest childhood, growing up all over the world and getting to know so many different languages and cultures. In many ways I admire and strive to be like you, which has led to so much fulfillment:</p>
								<div class="emoji-bullets">
									<p>🇩🇪 living overseas,</p>

								<p>So many of the things that make up who I am fundamentally come from you! We share:

									<p>👩🏽‍🏫 our drive to share our talents to mentor and help others...</p>

								<p> I'm going to run out of room!</p>
								<p>Many things you are still teaching me too — how to be as boundlessly generous, patient, and forgiving as you are so effortlessly. But I am so lucky to be able to keep learning from such a strong, loving, worldly woman.</p>
								<p>Happy Mother's Day, today and everyday! xx</p>
